# Homebrew cask. Publish by putting this file in a tap repository named
# homebrew-tap, at Casks/cad-viewer.rb:
#
#   brew tap andriivelhov/tap     # once
#   brew install --cask cadviewer
#
# Dropping the tap step entirely means getting into homebrew/cask itself, which
# requires the project to be notable and to follow their token conventions.
#
# Update `version` and `sha256` for each release; get the checksum with
#   shasum -a 256 packaging/CADViewer-<version>.dmg

  # been launched once. lsregister publishes the file types, and pluginkit
  # registers the two extensions directly - lsregister alone only sometimes
  # nudges them into being discovered, and can take a minute when it does.
